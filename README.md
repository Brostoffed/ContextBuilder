# ContextBuilder

ContextBuilder is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin that helps you generate and manage markdown contexts from selected project files. It provides a tool window with a history view, drag-and-drop support, and file filtering featuresâ€”all designed to streamline your workflow for building context for AI prompts, documentation, or code reviews.

## Features

- **Generate Context from Files:**  
  Generate a combined markdown context from selected files via a right-click action in the Project view.

- **Tool Window Interface:**  
  A docked tool window replicates the old modal dialog interface. It displays a history of generated contexts, a file tree view with preview, and a token count for the generated markdown.

- **Drag-and-Drop Support:**  
  Easily add files or entire folders to your history by dragging and dropping them onto the tool window. The plugin recursively collects all files from dropped directories.

- **History Management:**
    - **Sorting Options:**  
      Sort history entries by creation date (newest first) or by name.
    - **Renaming:**  
      Rename history entries to a custom label while still retaining the underlying date information.
    - **Filtering:**  
      Use a search field to filter history items and file tree contents.

- **Persistent State & Settings:**  
  The plugin persists your context history, file type exclusions, and markdown template across sessions. Adjust settings via the IntelliJ Settings/Preferences under Tools.

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourOrgOrUser/ContextBuilder.git
   ```
2. **Build the Plugin:**  
   Use Gradle to build the plugin:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew buildPlugin
   ```
3. **Install in IntelliJ IDEA:**
    - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
    - Go to **File > Settings > Plugins** (or **Preferences > Plugins** on macOS).
    - Click the gear icon and select **Install Plugin from Disk...**.
    - Choose the generated plugin ZIP file from `build/distributions`.

## Usage

### Generating Context
- **Right-click Action:**  
  In the Project view, right-click on one or more files/folders and select **Generate Context**. This action generates a markdown context, copies it to the clipboard, and adds a new history entry.

### Using the Tool Window
- **View History:**  
  Open the **Context Builder** tool window (by default docked on the right side of the IDE) to view all generated context history.
- **Drag-and-Drop:**  
  Drag files or folders from the Project view directly onto the tool window to create new history entries.
- **Sort & Filter:**  
  Use the combo box to sort history by "Date Desc" (default) or "Name Asc". Use the search field to filter history items.
- **Rename History Entries:**  
  Select a history item and click **Rename** to assign a custom label.
- **Preview & Regenerate:**  
  Selecting a history entry displays its file tree and a markdown preview. Click **Regenerate** to copy the markdown to your clipboard.
- **Clear, Export, or Import History:**  
  Use the provided buttons to clear the history or to export/import your history as JSON.
